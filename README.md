## Marvin's area of improvement API

Marvin prides himself on the IMPACT his code has on his clients.

Marvin's latest client desperately needs  help with this API code that is a pre-scaffolded Express/TypeScript Node JS app.
However, Marvin has many other clients that need his services, so he identified AREA OF IMPROVEMENT for this API and created a STEP UP OPPORTUNITY for you.
Marvin has documented all of client's requirements in the form of the unit tests and now it's up to you to implement the APIs!!!!

Marvin and his client are counting on you. You can't let them down!
